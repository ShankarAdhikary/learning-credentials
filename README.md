# Learning Credentials Portfolio

This repository documents my structured learning journey across
cybersecurity, programming, and database fundamentals.

Rather than serving as a simple collection of certificates, the focus is on:
- skills developed through coursework,
- progression of learning over time,
- clear and organized documentation of credentials.

## Repository Structure

- `skills.md` — consolidated overview of technical skills
- `timeline.md` — learning progression by year
- `domains/` — domain-wise breakdown of learning and credentials
- `data/` — structured metadata for certificates
- `evidence/` — selective supporting documents (where required)

## Domains Covered

- Cybersecurity  
- Programming  
- Databases  

## Verification

Where available, certificates include verification details provided by the
issuing platform. Offline or non-verifiable credentials are documented
transparently.

This repository is maintained as a public, reviewable record of foundational
technical learning and disciplined documentation practices.
